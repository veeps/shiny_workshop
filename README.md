# Data Visualization with Shiny Workshop

## Overview
This workshop is designed as a one-day intro to Shiny workshop. Today we'll cover some fundamentals to building Shiny apps and design-thinking. After this workshop, you will be able to:

- Build a Shiny App
- Load your own data
- Understand reactive functions
- Deploy to shinyapps.io
- Fundamentals of design-thinking

## Workshop format
We will be walking through examples throughout the course. If you get lost following along the live coding sessions, you can see the "final.R" file in the project folders for the full code.

We are going to work our way towards building [this](https://veeps.shinyapps.io/shiny_workshop/).

At the end of each break, I will push the updates for what we've done so far so you can follow along.
